            <h1>Welcome to Miguel's Music API</h1>
            <h3>Let me show you how this works!</h3>

            <h3>Assumption: GET Requests!</h3>
            <p>Whenever a reference such as "/example/another-example" is made, assume that the reference is to "https://music-api.miguelledesma.com:8443/example/another-example" trying
                to use it in the url. When referencing something similar such as "example/:new-example", the ":new-example" section only refers to using that specific section as a parameter,
                so when trying to use that section, it may take any varied parameter you can think of (within reason).
            </p>

            <h3>GET Requests</h3>
            <p>
                There are a 4 different types of GET requests.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a>/artists</a> returns all artists that exist in the records.</li>
                <li><a>/artists/:artist</a> returns all albums by the artist in the parameter.</li>
                <li><a>/artists/:artist/:album</a> returns all songs in the album parameter owned by the artist parameter.</li>
                <li><a>/artists/:albumYear</a> returns all albums by artists in a specific year.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <a>NOTE:</a> The "/:albumYear" parameter will only allow for integer values, not alphabetical characters.
            </p>
            <p>If you wish to use a GET request using curl, do it in this manner:</p>
            <p>curl https://music-api.miguelledesma.com:8443/artists/exampleArtist/exampleAlbum</p>
        </section>

            <h3>POST Requests</h3>
            <p>A post request will store the given parameters as a record when complete.
                The order of insertion is as follows:

                <li>Album Year</li>

            </ol>
            <p><a>NOTE:</a> The album year MUST be an integer.</p>
            <p>In order to create a new record, the curl request must follow this format:</p>
            <p>curl --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"artist": "exampleArtist", "album": "exampleAlbum", "albumYear": 2022, "song": "exampleSong"}' https://music-api.miguelledesma.com:8443/artists</p>
            <p><a>NOTE:</a> If you wish to include a single quote " ' " you must use this sequence of characters to include it " '\'' " (Double quotes not included).</p>
